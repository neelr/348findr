# Room Finder @ UCLA!

A quick website scraper I whipped up to check for open rooms at UCLAâ€”super fun to just find a random room to study in between classes. They're usually less crowded & easier to focus in!

Huge thanks to https://github.com/bobeta-c/Grid_Search_UCLA for the inspiration/making me aware of the grid search!
